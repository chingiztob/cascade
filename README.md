# Cascade (in Development)

**Cascade** is a **blazingly-fastâ„¢**  Rust-based library built, designed to provide the same core functionality as **NxTransit**, a Python library for creating and analyzing multimodal graphs of urban transit systems using GTFS data.

See the original [NxTransit documentation](https://nxtransit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an overview of the features being ported and enhanced in this version.
