def single_source_shortest_path_weight(

    """
    Finds the shortest path from source point
    to all other nodes in a time-dependent graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : PyTransitGraph
        The graph to search for the shortest path.
    dep_time : int
        The starting time.
    x: float
        lat of source.
    y: float
        lon of source point.

    Returns
    -------
    Dic[int, float]

    Implementation
    --------------
    This function uses a priority queue to explore the graph with
    almost classic Dijkstra's algorithm. The main difference is that the
    delay between two nodes is calculated based on the ``current time``
    and the sorted schedules of the edge.
